UnityLineMeshes
===============

Example of processing and using line meshes in Unity

In order to use this:
- Export a spline model to .obj
- Change the extension from .obj to .txt
- Add it to your unity project
- Right-click the txt file in the Unity project view and select "Process Line File".  This creates two files "NewLineMesh" and "NewLineModel".
- Rename "NewLineMesh" to whatever you want and add it to a mesh filter.

NOW YOU'RE DONE
